# ProjectDOT-by-Limewire
A dox organization tool, written by Limewire in Python.
 
Before you use this, I would like to thank my close friend and partner in crime Pascal for helping me through V1.

And a disclaimer: I am not responsible for what you do with this tool. 

This project is open-source and thus anyone can contribute to it and make it better.
I started this project due to Drizzy's Dox Tool being compromised with the "Newtonsoft" fake update, I don't want to deal with that shit.
You can now search usernames on here AND now you can geolocate IPs with V3 (check console). You can also automatically save your results, like Name, Address, Phone Number, IP, etc. to a .txt file.
Here is a resource to find usernames if you prefer instead to use a different tool: instantusername.com

V3 released! Check my github for updates.

and finally; have fun.
